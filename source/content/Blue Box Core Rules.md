## Acknowledgements

_Blue Box is directly inspired by, and even uses terms from the BIONICLE property, created by the LEGO corporation._

_Blue Box was not created in a vacuum. Blue Box itself is a working title, and one which directly references another BIONICLE TTRPG, once called Crimson Box, also known as Doronai-Nui. Some elements from Doronai-Nui are present in Blue Box as well. Some of this is because of their common source material, but some of it is in elements of the games themselves as direct inspiration. In particular, the spirit of customization underlying the weapon system._

_It is my belief that Doronai-Nui, created by [Red Star Games](https://www.redstargames.org/), is run by thoughtful members of the community making something cool. I was once a member of their Patreon, and ran a years-long campaign in the system. My hope is to broaden the choice of BIONICLE TTRPGs available to the community to suit different styles of play, so even more people can enjoy the incredible world of BIONICLE in the amazing form of Table-top Role-playing Games._

# The Game

**Blue Box is a tactical role-playing table-top game set in the world of LEGO's BIONICLE**, with an emphasis on character customization, armor destruction, positioning, and of course; teamwork.

## Required Materials

Define Game Master, Define GM, Define Required Materials.

**Blue Box** is a tactical table-top role-playing game set in the fantastic world of BIONICLE.

**To play Blue Box,** **you will need a set of dice** which includes a **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, and a **d12**. Gameplay is more likely to move along quickly if you have multiples of the d4s, d6s, and d8s, but is not required. You may use (4) or more of each from time to time. If you do not have any physical dice, you can instead use a digital dice-rolling application, easy to find online.

**You will also need a hex-based battle-map**, physical or digital. Combat and movement in Blue Box is tactical, and while it is possible to play without some kind of battle-map, many of the core combat mechanics the game is built around relies on precise positioning, so it is recommended. **Each hex represents (1) meter of distance.**

**You will need a token** which indicates your character's position on the battlemap, physical or digital.

**And finally, you will need a desire to create and play with all at the table**, including the _GM_, or _Game Master_. Blue Box is a Tabletop Role Playing game - or TTRPG for short - one which requires some imagination and a decent amount of reading. There is no required number of players or _GM_s - it is even possible to play by yourself as both the player and _GM_ at once.

**You as players and GMs have the power to alter or change any rule in Blue Box if it suits your table.** Discuss together how best to play. Some rules are specifically designated as optional.

_**(❢)**_ **_Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
_**While using the Ctrl+F or Cmd+F function to find specific rulings and definitions, try "Define X" to find the original reference/explanation. This allows you to ignore other times a specific rule is mentioned, but not defined.**_

## Modes of Play

Define Modes of Play

**In Blue Box, there are two modes of gameplay, which can be played separately as individual games, or together as one.**

**Adventure** is where the players describe their actions as they navigate the world while a Game-Master describes the world's response for them. The GM can create puzzles, characters, or various narratives for the players to influence and engage with.

Adventure is largely free-form, with very little rules dictating what you can do.

**Combat** is where the players control their own characters in turns, using their tools, powers, skills, and creative thinking, to fight and overcome enemies controlled by the GM - _or be defeated by them_. Of course, not a single combat has to end in death. It can, but most characters will have opportunities to end violent combats by incapacitating the enemy or routing them instead. _Not that those they face are playing by the same rules._

## Roll Types & Modifiers

Define Difficulty Class, Define DC, Define Ability Rolls, Define Ability Checks, Define Attack Rolls, Define Saves, Define Death Saves. Define d12  
 In Blue Box, **most attempts to complete an action successfully are decided by rolling a d12**. The _GM_ sets a _**Difficulty Class**_, or _**DC**_ based on the difficulty of the roll. In order for the roll to succeed, the roll result must match or exceed the _DC_. Succeed or fail, the _GM_ adjudicates the result, narrating what follows.

Often, the roll is modified, where bonuses are added or subtracted from the result. This depends on the type of d12 roll being performed as seen below:

**Ability Rolls/Ability Checks** will apply a character's stat modifier, depending on what stat that _ability_ falls under. If the character has an _ability bonus_ for that specific check, it is added as well. For a complete list of _abilities_, _ability bonuses_, _& stats,_ see [[#Stats, Abilities, & Checks]].

**Contested Checks/Contested Rolls** may require you and another being to roll checks against one another. Whichever check is highest after adding modifiers, wins. **In the event of a tie**, both parties roll a Power Die (✦) as a tiebreaker, repeating until a winner is chosen.

**Power Die** (**✦**), or simply notated as (**✦**) are a die that depends on your level. They begin as d4s at Level 1. See the _[[#Power Die (✦)]]_ [[#Power Die (✦)]] section for more.

**Attack Rolls** will apply a character's stat modifier, depending on the specific attack type, whether or not it is unarmed or with a weapon etc. On success, damage is rolled according to the attack type. The attacker may forgo some damage, and instead choose to destroy defensive armor called Plating.

Attack rolls target a being's _AC_, or _Armor Class_ instead of a DC, as determined by that target's stats and armor. For a breakdown on AC & armor, see the [[#Armor & Plating]] section.

**Saves** are special d12 rolls that are made to avoid an effect, or reduce its severity. A _save_ will apply a character's stat modifier to the result.

**Damage Rolls** reduce a target's _[[#Health & Healing|Health Points]]_, or _[[#Health & Healing|HP]]_. The type and number of dice rolled during a damage roll depends on what is causing the damage. If the target is the subject of an attack or effect, the damage is typically rolled using _Power Die_ (**✦**) or if they are subject to damage from an _object_ or specific _[[#Conditions & Statuses|condition]]_, they roll a static die according to that object or condition.

### Power Die (✦)

Define Power Die (✦), Define (✦)

**Power Die** (**✦**)**,** or simply (**✦**) are special dice that depend on the character's current level.

**Levels 1-3:** (**✦**) = _d4_  
**Levels 4-6:** (**✦**) = _d6_  
**Levels 7+:** (**✦**) = _d8_

They are used as modifiers, to roll damage, and are called for in other instances such as skills or actions.

The number of _Power Die_ (**✦**) rolled is defined by the action currently being taken. This is often notated as (**✦**), or (2**✦✦**), or (3**✦✦✦**) etc, depending on the number you are meant to roll.

### (+) Edge & (‒) Flaw ★

Define Edge, Define Flaw, Define (+) Edge, Define (-) Flaw

While making a d12 roll, sometimes other characters or the situation influences your roll, either by making it more difficult or less difficult. When (+) _**Edge**_ or (‒) _**Flaw**_ is applied, you will roll a **d4**, and add or subtract it from the d12 roll.

• You may only roll a **max of (+2) _Edge_** or a **max of (‒2) _Flaw_** in a single d12 roll.

• (+) _Edge_ or (‒) _Flaw_ cancel each other out:

_**Example:** (_+_3) Edge_ ‒ _(_‒_1) Flaw = (_+_2) Edge rolled. Make a regular d12 roll, and add_ (2)d4 to the results.  
_**Example:** (_+_1) Edge_ ‒ _(_‒_2) Flaw = (_‒_1) Flaw rolled. Make a regular d12 roll, and subtract_ (1)d4 from the results.  
_**Example:** (_+_3) Edge_ ‒ _(_‒_3) Flaw_ = _(0) of either. Make a regular d12 roll._

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

### Practiced Rolls ★

Define Practiced, Define Practiced Rolls

• If a being is _**Practiced**_ in an _ability_, a _save_, or on _attack rolls_ with a particular weapon, they re-roll any (1)s on the d12 and any (+) _Edge_ die.

_**(❢)**_ **_Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
• Being _Practiced_ in an attack roll **does not** affect the damage roll.

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

### Reach, Range

Define Reach, Define Range

• **In Blue Box, attacks and skills may make use of reach** (⚔) **or range** (➹)**,** depending on the weapon/skill used, or the action. If you have a melee weapon, it has a reach (⚔) determined by the weapon core used, and similarly with a ranged (➹) core.

• Attacks that successfully hit within reach (⚔) or range (➹) roll a Power Die (**✦**) of damage + relevant modifiers according to your weapon or skill. Some weapons/skills also have a Critical Area.

### Crits!

Define Critical Area, Define Crits

_**(❢) Critical Reach or Critical Range (❢)**_ is a particular position your weapon or power is most effective. Any time you are rolling damage for a target in your Critical Area, you will add an additional (✦) to the damage. This is known as a _Crit!_

As the GM, it is suggested to communicate an enemy's Critical Areas clearly, so players are able to make tactical decisions effectively, but feel free to discuss as a table if this is right for your campaign.

### Decisive Rolls & Hits

Define Decisive Rolls, Define Decisive Hit, Define Decisive Rolls & Hits, Define Nat 20, Define Nat 12, Define Natural 12

For all d12 ability checks or Saves, landing a (12) on the d12 results in an automatic success regardless of the DC. **This is called a Decisive Roll.** However, not all attempted actions are possible to succeed.

Impossible attempts cannot be bypassed by a "natural (12)" on the d12.

**If your Decisive Roll is an attack roll, it automatically hits**. When this occurs, choose (1) of the below options:

**Heavy Strike:** You deal the maximum damage possible on this hit.  
**Shatter:** Your target becomes [[#• Shattered|_Shattered_]], as their _Plating_ is reduced down to (0).  
**Hamstring:** You target the leg(s) of your enemy, reducing their movement by ½. This persists until they rest.  
**Destroy:** If your target is wielding a weapon, you may target the weapon as a part of your hit. They must make all attacks with this weapon with _(_‒_1) Flaw_ and cannot make use of any Modules if they are installed.  
**Unmask:** If they wear one, you may knock your target's mask off. It lands in an adjacent hex. See the below Unmasked ↶ condition, re-posted here for convenience.

| • Unmasked ↶ • Only beings who _must_ wear a Kanohi mask will take on the _Unmasked ↶_ condition: Toa, Matoran, or Turaga. • You are _[[#• Back-footed (↶)|Back-footed]]_ (↶). • At the start of your turn, make a DC (8) SPI save, or fall [[#• Unconscious ↶|Unconscious]] ↶. • If this condition lasts more than (6) hours: The _Unmasked_ being takes (1) d4 _Pure_ damage every (6) seconds. This damage cannot be reduced in any way. This damage can be paused though, as long as the _Unmasked_ being also has the [[#• Stasis ↶|_Stasis_]] ↶ condition. • The _Unmasked_ condition ends when the afflicted being has a Kanohi mask (powerless or not) placed on their face. | | ----- |

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#✏ Change-log]]

### Escalation Points (EP⇧)

Define Escalation Points (EP⇧), Define EP

In Blue Box, some actions or skills require Escalation Points to be spent. Escalation Points, or (EP⇧), are a finite resource that regenerate during periods of rest, or are regained when invoking your Backgrounds or Callings. Unless otherwise stated, you will never spend more than (1) (EP⇧) at once.

• You may take (1) level of [[#Exhaustion]] to use EP, if your current (EP⇧) is (0). ★

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

## Armor & Plating

Define Armor, Define Over-armor, Define Over Armor, Define Armor Set, Define Plating, Define Plating Reduction

**In Blue Box, most species are partially biological, and partially mechanical.** This typically means that nearly all living beings have some form of natural metal armor on their body. In addition to natural armor, many beings across the universe must build and maintain additional armor to give them further protection. In Blue Box, there are three important aspects to armor overall:

**Armor Class**, or _AC_, represents the likelihood of evading, deflecting, or being unharmed by an attack. It is the target number of an attack roll.

_**AC** is determined by a character's armor set, and DEX modifier._

|Most beings have a _Plating_ number, protecting them from some incoming damage. So long as they have Plating, they reduce all incoming damage by ½, to a minimum of (1). Once Plating is destroyed, this defensive effect ends._Plating is determined by a character's natural Plating, their armor set, and level._ When you land an attack roll against a target's AC (or BAC↶) you may either: • Roll damage. If the target has Plating, they will reduce the damage by ½, to a minimum of (1). • Before rolling, choose how many Power Die (✦) you will sacrifice. For every (✦) you sacrifice, destroy X Plating. X = half the max of your current (✦). _Examples:_ • _If your Power Die_ (✦) _is a d4, ½ of (4) is (2). = (2) Plating destroyed for each_ (✦). • _If your Power Die_ (✦) _is a d6, ½ of (6) is (3). = (3) Plating destroyed for each_ (✦). • _If your Power Die_ (✦) _is a d8, ½ of (8) is (4). = (4) Plating destroyed for each_ (✦).|
|---|

**Back-foot Armor Class**, or **BAC**, much like AC, represents being unharmed by an attack, but while the target is in a disadvantaged state, like being knocked off balance, or restrained. When a being is _[[#• Back-footed (↶)|Back-footed (↶)]]_, their **BAC** is the target number of an attack roll.

Many beings have really high Plating, and it is usually wise to destroy somebody's Plating before prioritizing damage.

Additionally, when [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed (↶)_]], a character is at risk of having their armor's _Plating_ damaged, as detailed below.

_**BAC** is determined by a character's armor set, and KNO modifier._

When you land an attack roll against a target's AC (or BAC↶) you may either:

• Roll damage. If the target has Plating, they will reduce the damage by ½, to a minimum of (1).

_or_

• Before rolling, choose how many Power Die (**✦**) you will sacrifice. For every (**✦**) you sacrifice, destroy X Plating on your target. Then roll damage, if you did not sacrifice all your (**✦**). **X** = half the max of your current (**✦**).

_**Examples:**_  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d4**, ½ of (4) is (2). = **(2) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d6**, ½ of (6) is (3). = **(3) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d8,** ½ of (8) is (4). = **(4) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).

**Medium Armor** adds (+1) to your AC, and (+1) to your Plating.  
**Light Armor** adds (+1) to your BAC, and (+1) to your AC.  
**Heavy Armor** adds (+3) to your Plating.

For more details on what your AC/BAC↶/Plating will be, see the [[#Character Creation]] section.

**_(❢)_ _Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
When you see the (↶) symbol next to a status or condition, that means that status also inflicts [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed (↶)_]]. _**★**_

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#✏ Change-log]]

## Damage & Modifiers

Define Damage, Define Damage Order, Define Damage Categories, Define Plating, Define Damage & Modifiers

Damage can come from different sources - [[#Falling Damage|falling from great heights]], a condition like [[#• Bleeding|_Bleeding_]], or being the target of a successful attack or effect. When damage is rolled, it either uses (**✦**), or other die as specified by the attack or effect. _(e.g. falling damage are always d4s.)_

**Damage** -  
When unspecified, harm is just damage, which is always subject to _Plating_ reduction.

**Elemental Damage** -  
Some beings can trigger additional effects when they deal certain elemental damage types. When multiple damage types occur at the same time, they should all be rolled and calculated separately. Some beings also have resistance, vulnerability, or immunity to specific damage types.. See below for the complete list:  
Fire, Ice, Water, Air, Stone, Earth, Iron, Magnetism, Gravity, Psychic, Lightning*, Plasma, Sonic, Plant-life, Acid, Light, and Shadow

***Lightning:** When the recipient of Lightning damage is partially or completely submerged in water, add a (**✦**) to any instance of Lightning damage.  
Define Elemental Damage Types  
**Pure** -  
When damage is _Pure_ damage, it cannot be reduced in any way unless specified otherwise. This damage type can still be used to destroy _Plating_ as normal, through damage dice being sacrificed. Sometimes Pure damage is applied to another type of damage. For instance if a skill deals Pure Gravity damage, that Gravity damage cannot be resisted through _Plating_, or _Resistances/Vulnerabilities_.  
Define Pure Damage, Define Armor Piercing, Define Piercing

**Resistance** -  
If a being has _Damage Resistance_ against a specific damage type, they reduce the incoming damage of that type to ½, rounded up. This is calculated before _Plating_. If this _Resistant_ being is [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶), the _Plating_ destroyed is halved to a minimum of (1).  
Define Resistance, Define Resistances

**Vulnerability** -  
If a being has _Damage Vulnerability_ against a specific damage type, they double incoming damage of that type, rounded up. This is calculated before _Plating_. If this _Vulnerable_ being is [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶), the _Plating_ destroyed is doubled.  
Define Vulnerability, Define Vulnerabilities. Define Vulnerable

**Immunity** -  
Some beings have _Damage Immunity_ against certain damage types. They negate all damage of that type, and it cannot affect their _Plating_.  
Define Immunity, Define Immunities, Define Immune

The order of operations when dealing damage is as follows: define ooo damage  
Choose which Power Die (✦) to sacrifice to destroy Plating >  
Roll remaining Power Die (✦) >  
Add any further modifiers >  
_Resistances_ & _Vulnerabilities_ applied >  
Halve damage if target has _Plating_ >  
_Apply damage to THP_ > then _HP_

_**(❢)**_ **_Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
_**Damage rolls are not affected by (+) Edge or (‒) Flaw!**_

### Health & Healing

Define Health & Healing, Define Health Points, Define HP, Define Healing, Define THP

In Blue Box, a being's life-force is expressed through their _**Health Points**_, or _**HP**_. When a character's _HP d_rops to (0), they take on the [[#💀 Down & Out ↶|_Down_]] ↶ condition, with even a possibility of death

_**Temporary Health Points**_, or _**THP**_, are a type of health on top of their _HP_. If a character has _THP_, and they take damage, the _THP_ is the first to be reduced after other possible damage modifiers. _THP_ expires at the beginning of any type of rest. Any time you receive _THP_ when you already have _THP_, they do not stack. Instead, take the highest of the sources.

**Character Creation Reference: Calculating _HP_** -  
**At character creation**, roll 7d4. You may re-roll any (1)s. Then after adding this result, add your FOR modifier. This final number is your _HP_.. This is calculated before _Plating_. If this _Vulnerable_ being is [[#Back-footed]] (↶), the _Plating_ destroyed is doubled.  
Define Vulnerability, Define Vulnerabilities. Define Vulnerable

**Immunity** -  
Some beings have _Damage Immunity_ against certain damage types. They negate all damage of that type, and it cannot affect their _Plating_.  
Define Immunity, Define Immunities, Define Immune

The order of operations when dealing damage is as follows: define ooo damage  
Choose which Power Die (✦) to sacrifice to destroy Plating >  
Roll remaining Power Die (✦) >  
Add any further modifiers >  
_Resistances_ & _Vulnerabilities_ applied >  
Halve damage if target has _Plating_ >  
_Apply damage to THP_ > then _HP_

_**(❢)**_ **_Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
_**Damage rolls are not affected by (+) Edge or (‒) Flaw!**_

### Health & Healing

Define Health & Healing, Define Health Points, Define HP, Define Healing, Define THP

In Blue Box, a being's life-force is expressed through their _**Health Points**_, or _**HP**_. When a character's _HP d_rops to (0), they take on the [[#💀 Down & Out ↶|_Down_]] ↶ condition, with even a possibility of death

_**Temporary Health Points**_, or _**THP**_, are a type of health on top of their _HP_. If a character has _THP_, and they take damage, the _THP_ is the first to be reduced after other possible damage modifiers. _THP_ expires at the beginning of any type of rest. Any time you receive _THP_ when you already have _THP_, they do not stack. Instead, take the highest of the sources.

**Character Creation Reference: Calculating _HP_** -  
**At character creation**, roll 7d4. You may re-roll any (1)s. Then after adding this result, add your FOR modifier. This final number is your _HP_.

## Stats, Abilities, & Checks

Define Stats, Define Abilities, Define Ability Checks, Define Checks

In Blue Box, there are (5) stats, and multiple abilities that fall underneath them. Each stat is given a modifier at character creation, which adds or subtracts to skill checks, saves, and various other rolls in the game.

**Fortitude**, or **FOR** is your physical strength and toughness. Those with high FOR usually have higher _HP_, and excel at tests of endurance. Some _Tools_ use FOR modifiers as well.  
**Dexterity**, or **DEX** is your reflex and finesse. Beings with high DEX typically take less hits since DEX grants _AC_ bonuses, and are well-suited to stealth or acrobatics. Some _Tools_ use DEX modifiers as well.  
**Spirit**, or **SPI** is your strength of will and awareness of others. Beings of high SPI can tap into their powers more efficiently than some, and excel at reading others - even those incapable of communicating themselves.  
**Charisma**, or **CHA** is your presence and social influence. Beings of high CHA make fantastic leaders, and are usually great speakers, often able to convince others to see things their way.  
**Knowledge**, or **KNO** is your intellectual power. Those with high KNO are great crafters or healers, and are well-suited as navigators or strategists. KNO also is used to determine your _BAC_. Some _Tools_ and equipment benefit from KNO modifiers as well.

Often, a character will be made to make an ability check. These are further modified by ability bonuses, which are applied at character creation and at level up. This can not exceed your current level. See below for the full list of abilities and their governing stats. Sometimes an ability check might not fall under a specific ability, in which case, discuss with your GM if it's best to use a roll that only adds your stat mod instead.

**Fortitude (FOR):**  
**Strength:** When performing athletic feats which require great force, or tests of physical prowess such as swimming in heavy rapids or climbing sheer cliff-faces.  
**Intimidation*:** When attempting to frighten or coerce other beings through a show of physical strength.  
**Grapple** ↶**:** When attempting to hold or restrain another being.

**Dexterity (DEX):**  
**Acrobatics:** When performing physical feats which require deftness, or control over one's body, such as leaping over obstacles, or fitting through a narrow passageway.  
**Pilot:** When attempting to control a vehicle or rideable animal. ★  
**Sleight of Hand:** When attempting to use fine motor control, such as attempting to unlock a door, pick-pocket, or hide something on one's person.  
**Stealth:** When attempting to move somewhere unnoticed, or remain unseen.

**Spirit (SPI):**  
**Focus:** When attempting to maintain control over an ongoing ability, or to perform a particularly difficult action while under high pressure.  
**Insight:** When attempting to make a read on a being's general attitude, mood, or feelings.  
**Perception:** When attempting to notice details, auditory or visual, or as a test of general awareness.

**Charisma (CHA):**  
**Persuasion:** When attempting to convince others of something.  
**Deception:** When attempting to lie or act convincingly.  
**Performance:** When attempting to impress an audience with theatrics, dance, or a musical instrument.  
**Intimidation*:** When attempting to frighten or coerce other beings through threatening statements.  
**Rahi Handling:** When attempting to control, soothe, or train Rahi.

**Knowledge (KNO):**  
**Medicine:** When attempting to stabilize an injured being, or identify medicinal ingredients and practices.  
**Investigation:** When attempting to effectively research a topic, piece together information already acquired, or to search for clues in a particular place.  
**History:** When attempting to recall information on a particular place, peoples, or profession.  
**Navigation:** When attempting to plot effective courses across landscapes, or to identify current whereabouts with contextual information such as position of stars, terrain, climate etc.  
**Survival:** When attempting to forage for resources, create comfortable places of rest, and to accurately identify flora and fauna.  
**Crafting:** When attempting to build or repair materials such as armor or tools, or to make modifications to such things.  
**Hacking:** When attempting to access or use electronic systems such as data centers, or electronic doors.

_*Intimidation can use either the FOR modifier or CHA modifier, but not both at once._

- Changed 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

### Focus & Focus Checks

Define Focus Checks, Define Focusing

In Blue Box, some ongoing skills or actions require _Focus_. Beings cannot maintain Focus on more than one skill at a time. Additionally, when a being is "_Focusing_" and they take damage, they must roll a _Focus_ check to see if they can maintain these actions. On a success, nothing changes, and the _Focused_ skill continues, but on a failure, it ends.

**The DC for Focus checks is equal to the damage applied to THP/HP to a minimum of DC (6).**

Define Starting & Ending Combat, Define Starting Combat, Define Ending Combat, Define Combat Resolution, Define Initiative

Sometimes, disagreements come to blows in Blue Box. When all else fails, fighting begins.

**Order of Initiative**, or just initiative, is the order of turns characters in a combat follow. To decide the Order of Initiative, every character present in a combat rolls a d12, and adds their DEX modifier. The characters act in order of the results, from highest to lowest. In the event of a tie, the GM decides which order those fall into, or they let the players decide. It's very advantageous to be earlier in the initiative order than your enemies, as you'll be able to take the better positions, or get some early damage or status effects on your targets.

When combat starts, there are a few things to consider before rolling for initiative:

• **Does anybody involved in this fight remain undetected?** Characters that are [[#• Hidden|_Hidden_]] will add (+1) Edge to their initiative roll.  
• **Has the party as a whole coordinated a well-timed strike?** If the majority of the party positions themselves and prepares to activate certain skills or actions all at once, or on signal, the whole party adds (+1) Edge to their initiative roll. Stacks with being Hidden!  
• **In the event that one party acts before all others in initiative**, the slower party is all [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶) until their own turn begins.

Once initiative is rolled, combat starts, and each character will take their turns in order. A round usually lasts (6) seconds, meaning (10) rounds are about a minute in length.

**Not every combat ends with death in Blue Box.** Combat ends when all but one party is routed, [[#💀 Down & Out ↶|Down & _Out_]] ↶, or surrenders - or when the GM feels it is appropriate.

**When an NPC loses all of their armor Plating - becoming [[#• Shattered|_Shattered_]] - they might rethink their engagement in a deadly combat**. When appropriate, the GM may make that NPC roll a SPI save to determine their next actions, setting the DC themselves based upon the scenario they face. They may choose to give up to the party, or attempt to flee, or decide it's time to fight to the death.

When initiative ends, the game resumes as normal, and returns to the Adventure mode, where players can freely move about and act as they wish.

## Actions & Action Economy

Define Actions, Define Action Economy, Define AP

While in combat in Blue Box, you are more restricted in your actions. While the adventure portion of the game is more free form, in combat you must rely on skills you have trained in. In the heat of the moment you will exert yourself, likely taking damage or expending resources.

define **Action Points** ordefine **AP** is what a character uses to take various actions, use a power, make an attack etc. while in combat. Most player characters have **2AP** per turn.

define **Actions** cost AP and can be done during your turn. Characters may select any number and combination of actions, so long as they do not exceed their total AP. Each action available during combat states the amount of AP used.

Define **Free Actions** are actions which do not cost AP. Characters can use multiple _Free Actions_ each turn, but use each option only once per turn, up to a limit determined by the GM and player together if it becomes implausible.

Define **Reactions** are special actions a character can take in response to other character actions. A character gains the ability to use (1) _Reaction_ at the start of their first turn in combat, may only use one _Reaction_ per round, and regains the ability to do so at the end of their turn.

### Combat Actions

Define Reach, Define Range, Define Critical Area, Define Crits

These are universal actions beings may take while in combat. These actions can be taken outside of combat as well, and they follow the same rules, but where they are most often seen will be after initiative is rolled and until the combat is resolved.

#### • Attacks ⚔ ➹

_1AP_ **|** define **Attack |** ⚔ ➹

If a target is within your reach or range you may attack them. Roll a d12, and add any relevant stat modifiers. If a being is _Practiced_ in this roll, they re-roll any (1)s on the d12 or (+) _Edge_ die.

If the d12 lands on a (12), it becomes a [[#Decisive Rolls & Hits|_Decisive Hit_]]. If the result otherwise matches or exceeds the target's AC (or BAC if they are [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶)), the attack is a success.

When you land an attack roll against a target's AC (or BAC↶) you may either:

|• Roll damage. If the target has Plating, they will reduce the damage by ½, to a minimum of (1).|• Before rolling, choose how many Power Die (✦) you will sacrifice. For every (✦) you sacrifice, destroy X Plating. Afterwards, roll damage as normal.|
|:--|:--|

**X** = half the max of your current (**✦**).

_**Examples:**_  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d4**, ½ of (4) is (2). = **(2) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d6**, ½ of (6) is (3). = **(3) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).  
• _If your Power Die_ (**✦**) _is a **d8,** ½ of (8) is (4). = **(4) Plating destroyed** for each_ (**✦**).

_1AP_ **|** define **Shove** ↶ **|** ⚔ 1m, Reach, Melee

Make an attack roll against a target within 1m. On a success, your target is pushed away from you 1m, and is [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶) until the start of your next turn. This action deals no damage.

_Reaction_ **|** define **Opportunity Attack |** ⚔ Melee

If a being voluntarily moves at 2m (or more) within your reach/range, React! Roll a weapon attack roll. On a successful hit your target cannot continue moving, stopping in the hex they were in when you reacted.

_1AP_ **|** define **Unarmed/Improvised Attack** | 1m Melee

If you have no Tool or skill making the attack, and you're using your fists/feet or something as simple as a chair you've picked up, you may target somebody within 1m to make an Unarmed/Improvised Attack. This attack will use DEX/FOR as the modifier for the attack and damage rolls, your choice.

_1AP_ **|** define **Flash Shot** ↶ **|** ➹

Select a being within line-of-sight and within range. Make a ranged attack against them, on a success, this attack does no damage, but [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-foots_]] (↶) them until the end of your next turn.

_1AP_ **|** define **Beyond Range |** ➹

For 1AP may make a ranged attack outside of your range (up to twice the range of the original weapon), though you roll with (**‒**1) _Flaw_.

#### • More Actions

_1AP_ **|** define **Grapple** ↶ **|** 1m

Select a target within 1m of you, and make a Grapple check. If your result matches or exceeds the target's AC (or BAC if they are [[#• Back-footed (↶)|_Back-footed_]] (↶), then the Grapple is a success, and they take on the [[#• Grappled ↶|_Grappled_]] ↶ condition. While you become their [[#• Grappler|_Grappler_]].

_1AP_ **|** define **Trip |** ⚔ ➹

Make an attack roll on a target within reach or range. On a success, they fall [[#• Prone|_Prone_]]. This action deals no damage.

_1AP_ **|** define **Defensive Stance** | Self

Defensive Stance, or Def. Stance increases your AC and BAC by (2) until the start of your next turn. If you make any attack rolls as part of a Reaction while in this stance, you may add (+1) _Edge_ to your attack roll.

_1AP_ **|** define **Hunker**

If you are in Cover, you can spend 1AP to Hunker, changing the (**‒**1) _Flaw_ to (**‒**2) _Flaw_ for any ranged attacks against you affected by this same Cover. Hunker remains in effect so long as you remain adjacent to the Cover.

For a full breakdown on Cover, see the [[#Cover & Height Advantage]] sub-section.

_1AP_ **|** define **Hide**

So long as you are not currently seen, you may spend 1AP in an attempt to evade detection. You take on the [[#• Hidden]] condition, which is reposted below for your convenience:

| _• Hidden_ • While _Hidden_, you cannot be targeted by attacks. Area-of-effects may target you if your general location is known. • You add (+1) Edge to initiative rolls if you are _Hidden_ at the time of the roll. • You add (+1) Edge to _Hidden_ attack rolls. Hidden ends… • …after you make an attack roll or force a Save. • …when you start or end your turn in line-of-sight of an enemy (unless [[#• Invisible|Invisible]]). • …when an enemy succeeds on a contested 1AP Stealth vs Perception roll against you. | | ----- |

_1AP_ **|** define **Search**

Roll contested Perception vs Stealth roll against any Hidden targets you know the general location of. If you succeed against any targets, they are no longer Hidden from you.

_1AP_ **| Kanohi/Weapon Swapping**

Equip, unequip, trade your Kanohi or weapon.

_1AP (variable)_ **|** define **Object Interaction**

Any manipulation of an object, such as picking up something, or activating a switch is typically done as a 1AP action. Some more complex interactions such as writing something down or hacking into a well protected computer console may be deemed by the GM to take longer than 1AP at their discretion.

#### • Held Actions ★

You may pre-select an action or skill that triggers as a Reaction. Spend the desired action's AP cost, then wait for the trigger. This action is held until the start of your next turn.

_**Examples:**_  
"I will attack with my weapon as a Reaction when X target rounds this corner and enters my reach."  
"I will wait for Y ally to move out of these hexes, then React! to use Fire Zone."

- Changed 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#✏ Change-log]]

#### • Movement ⇒

Define Movement

A character can use any (1) availabledefine **Move Action ⇒** per turn. A character can spend their Move Action to move equal to their total speed.

_Move Action ⇒_ define **General Movement**

Move up to your speed all at once (or split up between other actions).

_1/round, Move Action ⇒_ define **Quick-step**

_1/round,_ move up to 1m without provoking Reactions.

_1/round, 1AP ⇒_ define **Dash**

1/round, dashing allows you the second use of a Move Action ⇒ on your turn.

_1AP ⇒_ define **Disengage**

Your movement this turn does not provoke Reactions. You can no longer make attack rolls or force saves this turn.

### Escalation Counter

Define Escalation Counter, Define (EP⇧)Counter, Define Optional Rules  
**Optional Rules →**  
_This section is considered optional, according to the tone and style of your game. As players and GM, discuss if you'd like to include these options in your campaign._

Using the _Escalation Counter_ provides the party with an opportunity to choose from a few key actions or bonuses to resolve a combat more quickly at the cost of having spent resources previously.

Place a counter on the table for all to see. Use a die, or a numbered strip of paper you move a coin along etc. The counter is the number of Player Characters x (2) + (2). ★

**(1) Player Character:** Counter goes up to **(4)**  
(**2) PCs:** Counter goes up to **(6)**  
(**3) PCs:** Counter goes up to **(8)**  
(**4) PCs**: Counter goes up to **(10)** etc.

This counter can be managed by the GM, or by the players. Start the counter with (1).

**In combat:** 1/turn, when a player character expends an _Escalation Point_, increase the counter by (1).

On any player's turn, if their party's escalation counter is maxed out, the party may choose to activate it. They may choose (1) of the below options:

• The party may immediately make any 1AP action(s) of their choice in any order. Once all these actions are resolved, reset the counter to (1), and continue the turn order as normal.  
• Every member of the party regains (2**✦✦**) of healing - if this brings a being beyond their max, the left-over healing becomes THP. ★ Once the rolls are made, reset the counter to (1), and continue the turn order as normal.

The number on the escalation counter persists between combats, meaning if a combat ends with a (3) on the counter, it will return with a (3) at the start of the next combat.

_**(❢)**_ **_Critical Tip_ _(❢)_** ★  
_**Taking on a level of Exhaustion to spend (EP⇧) will still tick up the Escalation Counter!**_

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#✏ Change-log]]

**←** _Optional Rules_

## Movement & Terrain

Define Movement, Define Speed

**In Blue Box,** each character can use a _Move Action_ 1/round. Typically, when somebody takes movement, they can move up to their speed as determined by their species. A being with 6m speed can move 6m in a standard move action. This movement can be taken between other actions as well. For instance, a being with 6m speed, could move 3m, perform two Attack Actions, and then continue their remaining 3m of movement.

But there are many different ways to traverse the battle-map other than walking or running! Some situations may call for you to Climb, Swim, or Dig. Some of these would require ability checks to do successfully, depending on the particular scenario. It is up to the _GM_ to determine whether or not something requires a roll, or ongoing rolls.

**Climbing** unaided is done at **½ speed**: _1m moved = 2m spent_  
**Swimming** unaided is done at **½ speed**: _1m moved = 2m spent_  
**Digging** unaided is done at **¼ speed**: _1m moved = 4m spent_

### Terrain & Terrain Types

Define Difficult Terrain, Define Dangerous Terrain

**Difficult Terrain** slows down those who move within it. These can be icy floors, knee deep bogs, or anything that could typically impede movement.

Moving 1m in Difficult Terrain actually requires 2m of movement spent. When a being is moving from regular terrain into Difficult Terrain, it costs 2m. But, a being moving from Difficult Terrain into regular terrain only requires 1m of movement.

**Dangerous Terrain** has the potential to damage those within it. This can be ground covered in spikes, areas lit aflame, or anything that could reasonably harm somebody.

When a being first enters Dangerous Terrain, and every time they begin their turn within it, they must make a Save associated with that terrain. Upon a failure, they take (1) d4 of damage - the type of damage will depend on the specific terrain.

If there is no Save or DC associated with the particular area, it is up to the GM to decide both.

### Cover & Height Advantage

Define Cover, Define Height Advantage

**In Blue Box**, some obstacles which partially obscure _beings_ grant _Cover_. These can be railings, low fences, piles of rubble etc. If a ranged attack's trajectory passes over the obstacle which grants _Cover_, and the target is adjacent to the obstacle, the attack must be made with _Flaw_. This has no effect on melee attacks.

Most objects which grant _Cover_ can be vaulted over, but doing so requires 2m of movement instead of 1m.

_**Cover**_ **is placed on the battlemap on the lines _between_ hexes**, meaning you must be in a hex with the _Cover_ on the border to be considered adjacent as shown below as the blue lines:

![[image2.png]]

Some Skills and actions allow beings to place or build Cover in Blue Box. When this is done, beings are given a certain number of hex edges to place down in a configuration according to that Skill or action. In the above example, there are (7) hex edges which provide Cover.

**In Blue Box**, when one being is positioned 1m or higher above another being, they gain _Height Advantage_ when making ranged or melee **★** attacks against them, adding (+1) _Edge_ to their attack rolls.

In the below example, the Blue Token character will add (+1) _Edge_ to their attack rolls against the Red Token character, since they are standing 3m above the Red Token character, giving them _Height Advantage_:

![[image3.png]]

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

### Falling Damage

Define Falling Damage

If a being falls 3m, they take (1) d4 of _Pure_ damage. For every additional 1m of height beyond 3m, add a d4.

## Roleplay & Travel

### Backgrounds

Define Backgrounds

**Who are you? Or; who _were_ you?**

In Blue Box, at character creation, all beings must select a Background. These provide some bonuses to certain ability checks, provide additional actions while resting, or provide you with knowledge of particular subjects, places, people, or careers. They also provide you with a means to regain (EP⇧) at the end of the session.

### Out-of-Combat Actions

Define OOC Actions, Define Out of Combat Actions, Define Out-of-Combat Actions

**Actions during adventure are much less restrictive than in-combat actions**. If you have the elemental control of a Toa of Stone, under less intense circumstances, there is a much wider range of actions available to you. Creating stone staircases, examining stone objects or artifacts, or other imaginative uses of those powers are encouraged.

What is actually possible or not will be adjudicated by the _GM_, and they may ask for an ability check such as "Give me a flat SPI roll", or ask you to spend an _Escalation Point_ depending on the difficulty or complexity of the action.

Any actions granted to you for in-combat action can still be used outside of combat freely.

### Rest & Repair

Define Rest, Define Long Rest, Define Short Rest, Define Repair

**Rests**, split up into _Short Rests_, and _Long Rests_, allow characters to spend time on projects, regain health, decrease exhaustion, and make repairs to their _Tools_ and armor. Typically, a _Short Rest_ is somewhere between 2-5 hours, and a _Long Rest_ is 6-9 hours long. Anything longer than that is considered extra downtime. These exact times may vary depending on the tastes of the players and _GM_ at the table.

If _Initiative_ is rolled during what is meant to be a _Long Rest_, it instead becomes a _Short Rest_. But, if _Initiative_ is rolled during a _Short Rest_, it typically remains unchanged.

**A character does not need to sleep the entire time** during these rests to benefit from their effects! In fact, only some of the time during a typical rest is a character _[[Unconscious]]_ ↶, up to the discretion of the _GM_. Other time is spent potentially interacting with other members of a camp or resting place, and planning the next moves. Each being during the rest will be able to make _Rest Activities_ (•••) as detailed below.

**During a _Short Rest (2-5 hours)_: ★**  
• Choose **(3)** _Rest Activities_ (•••) of any configuration or order.  
_You may take the same action multiple times unless otherwise stated._

**During a _Long Rest (6-12 hours)_: ★**  
• Choose **(5)** _Rest Activities_ (•••) of any configuration or order.  
_You may take the same action multiple times unless otherwise stated._

_**Rest Activities**_ **(•••):**

_Regeneration & Repair:_  
••• Roll (2**✦✦**) + FOR + current level of HP. Reroll (1)s and do not count negative FOR modifiers in this roll.  
••• Roll (**✦**) + SPI + current level of Escalation Points (EP⇧). Reroll (1)s and do not count negative SPI modifiers in this roll.  
••• Repair your (or an ally's) Plating up to its maximum.  
••• Lose (2) levels of Exhaustion.  
••• Repair your (or an ally's) damaged/destroyed weapon or Tool.

_Crafting & Modifications:_  
••• Swap, remove, or install (1) Tool Module on a Tool you are Practiced with.  
••• Spend time crafting items from the [[_Simple Craftables_]] list equal to (1) + KNO. You may craft multiple of the same item.

_Practice & Preparation:_  
••• Spend time learning how to use a weapon you are not Practiced with. Doing this twice will make you Practiced in that Tool.  
••• You do some self-reflection or meditation. Add (+1) _Edge_ to all _Focus_ checks until your next rest.  
_(You cannot take this action more than once per rest)_  
••• Spend time studying maps or other navigation information of your current or upcoming location. Make all _Navigation_ checks until your next rest with (+1) _Edge_.  
_(You cannot take this action more than once per rest)_  
••• Keep watch. During the rest, any and all _Perception_ checks to detect approaching beings are made with (+1) _Edge_, and in the event you and your party are attacked by beings or constructs you detected, add (+1) _Edge_ to your _Initiative_ rolls.  
_(You cannot take this action more than once per rest)_

_Extra:_  
••• Gift your _Rest Activity_ to an ally. This can stack.

- Added 04/03/2023. See ✏ [[#Change-log]]

**_(❢)_ _Critical Tip_ _(❢)_**  
_**If there are other things that you and the GM decide you would like to do during a rest, in or around your resting place, but feel it would require a significant amount of time, it may be a Rest Activity**_ (•••)_**.**_

### Camps & Resting Places

Define Camp, Define Resting Place, Define Camp Bonuses

**Optional Rules →**  
_This section is considered optional, according to the tone and style of your game. As players and GM, discuss if you'd like to include these options in your campaign._

**Camps** or resting places may affect your _Short_ and _Long Rests_.

While making camp in the wilderness at the start of a rest, each member of the party makes _Survival_ checks DC (10), to improve the camp beyond the standard. The party may choose (1) of the following _Camp Bonuses_ for every successful _Survival_ check:

**Camp Bonuses:**  
• The party is able to find a hidden alcove, clearing, or otherwise obscure their resting place. Checks to find your camp are done so with (**‒**1) _Flaw._  
• The party is able to find more comfortable arrangements, and all members can re-roll any number of (**✦**) once when restoring _HP_, and automatically lose (1) Exhaustion level.  
• The party is able to set up some type of alarm or trap to alert them of approaching beings. If triggered, the party adds an additional (+1) _Edge_ to their _Initiative_ rolls. A character may roll a _Crafting_ check, and record the result. The trap(s) may be detected with an opposing _Investigation_ check against that result.

**←** _Optional Rules_

### Equipment & Items ★

Define Crafting, Define Craftables, Define Simple Craftables

#### • Simple Craftables ★

Define Crafting, Define Craftables, Define Simple Craftables

During rests or while traveling, it may be possible to construct items for use within the party, or to sell/trade.

Below is a list of _**Simple Craftables**_, which any character may attempt to create, so long as they make the required _Crafting_ DC. A failed roll does not result in the loss of required components.

**Please Note**  
_In the current build of Blue Box, crafting as a whole is left quite light, and will be fleshed out further at a later date. This, coupled with the Rest Activity allows for Crafters to fill a niche of the party which benefits all for now._  
_- Palm_

• **Sana Sphere** - Crafting DC (8) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (4) hour each ]  
A sphere which fits in the palm of your hand. Crushing it as a 1AP action allows the user to absorb energy stored within, restoring HP to themselves or for an adjacent ally. The healing is a (**✦**) + the crafters KNO _stat_.  
Define Sana Sphere

**• Payload Canister** - Crafting DC (10) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (4) hours each ]  
An additional canister which attaches to a _Grenade_, increasing the power of its effects. If you use a _Grenade_ as part of a skill, you may increase the effect by (**✦**), or impose (‒1) _Flaw_ on a save to evade it. This is a one-time use item. A _Payload Canister_ cannot on its own be used as a _Grenade_.  
Define Payload Canister

**• Lightstone Holster** - Crafting DC (6) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (2) hour each ]  
A strap or harness which allows the wearer to keep a lightstone out, providing light, without the use of their hands. The holster also comes with a cover which can be used to smother the stone, preventing light from shining through.  
Define Lightstone Holster  
**• Rope** - Crafting DC (6) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (3) hours each ]  
A rope or cable, which is 18m in length. Can be used to easily rappel down vertical walls. When tying, make a _Crafting_ check. If an enemy wants to untie the rope without destroying it, they must contest that result with their own _Crafting_ check.  
Define Rope

**• Air Bladder** - Crafting DC (8) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (3) hours each ]  
A container which can hold liquids, no heavy solids, but most commonly is used to store air while underwater. There is enough air in an air bladder to give (1) hour of breathable air, and can be shared between beings, the air remaining dividing equally between all who use it.  
Define Air Bladder

**• Bamboo Disk** - Crafting DC (5) -  
[ **Time required:** As part of a _Rest Bonus Action_, or (3) hours each ]  
A simple throwing disk, made of bamboo. This DEX based weapon can be thrown from 1-12m as a 1AP ranged attack, and can _Crit!_ at the 10m mark, dealing a (**✦**) + DEX of damage. Hit or miss, the disk lands adjacent to the throw target, and can be picked up again as a 1AP action.  
Define Bamboo Disk

#### Focused ★

Define Focused

• The rules of Focusing and Focus checks are restated below, copied from the [[#Focus & Focus Checks]] section.

In Blue Box, some ongoing skills or actions require _Focus_. When an ongoing action has the _Focus_ tag, it means they cannot perform another action at the same time that requires _Focus_ too. Additionally, when a being is "_Focusing_" and they take damage, they must roll a _Focus_ check to see if they can maintain these actions. On a success, nothing changes, and the _Focused_ skill continues, but on a failure, it ends.

**The DC for Focus checks is equal to the damage received, or (6), whichever is higher.**

• This condition ends when the _[[#Grappled ↶]]_ being breaks the Grapple, when you are _[[#Down & Out]]_ ↶ or fall _[[#Unconscious]]_ ↶, or when you choose to end it as a _Free Action_ on your turn.

Here is the below action to Grapple, for convenience:

_1AP_ **| Grapple** ↶

Select a target within 1m of you, and make a Grapple check. If your result matches or exceeds the target's AC (or BAC if they are [[#Back-footed]] (↶), then the Grapple is a success, and they take on the _[[#Grappled ↶]]_  condition. While you become their _[[#Grappler]]_.

**Last Updated:** 04/03/2023

**New to Blue Box:**  
**Player Characters and Progression:**

- There are many balancing changes to the character creation system. Beings now start Level 1 with a lower Stat array, your number of (EP⇧) is calculated using your SPI stat, less skills.
- Tools at level (1) start with (4⬡⬡⬡⬡) instead of (5⬡⬡⬡⬡⬡) for now.
- There is a whole new level-up system. More adjustments to progression to come.

**Balance Changes:**

- The [Protosteel Materials module](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.xhh01cmuvlt5) now costs ⬡⬡ instead of ⬡.
- The [Integrated Cord ↶ module](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.ndg4u4kqoxeu) now allows you to Grapple ↶ a target within 3m.
- The [Hooked Cable module](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.c6ws2wk8ve7j) now can pull in targets from 4m instead of within reach.
- [Fire Armor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.lscaggr8302h) now automatically deals damage to your Grappled ↶ enemies within 1m, and makes you Resistant to Ice damage while active.

**Actions:**

- You may now take on Exhaustion levels to spend [[#Escalation Points (EP⇧)]] if you have none.
- Kanohi Swapping in combat now is the [[#Combat Actions|same action]] as Tool/Weapon swapping.

**Resting:**

- [Resting no longer has automatic HP, EP, or (Plating regeneration)[[#Rest & Repair]]. Beings must choose from a list of actions what they would like to do during the rest. Hopefully this makes resting more meaningful, and rewards characters in good shape prior to the rest, freeing up the chance to take other actions such as crafting items as bonuses.

**New Calling:**

- [The Duelist has arrived](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.g1v84orhbu0b). Parry and expertly outperform your enemies in melee weapon duels.
- [The Lancer has arrived](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.wktqqiojptgn). Deal additional damage with Mle. Long weapons, and keep your targets at a comfortable distance.

- [Optional Death Save](#%E2%96%B8-roll-types--modifiers) rules have been added to the game for a more intense style of play.
    
    - Also, added the ability to stop somebody from dying without directly healing them (whoops! It wasn't in the game! This was caught in play-testing lmao)

**Conditions:**

- All conditions that give [[#Back-footed (↶)]] whenever they are referenced so you always know if a condition gives Back-foot (↶). This should improve quality of life, and encourage players to choose actions they immediately know will allow them to destroy enemy armor to ensure an important hit lands.
- The _[[#Dazed ↶ ★]]_ condition makes its debut - drop your enemies to the bottom of the turn-order.
- The _[[#Poisoned ★]]_ condition arrives - I hope it makes you ill.
- [[#Grappler]] and [[#Focused ★]] are now technically classified as conditions - this is mostly to make referencing the rules for both easier.
- [[#Grappled ↶]] beings now roll DEX saves with (‒1) Flaw.
- [[#Disoriented ↶]]  beings now make attacks with (‒1) Flaw.

**General Changes:**

- [[#Hidden]] has seen some changes to improve rules for Invisibility in anticipation of the Kanohi Huna.
- The optional [[#Escalation Counter]] language is now party dependent. Now, the Escalation Counter is the number of PCs is multiplied by (2), then + (2).
- Two [Iron Toa traits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hje1JBel1nDGut5YHbyM1nBqjj0go7uECwnX_vCOI4U/edit#heading=h.mir8i46lzyny) rebalanced.
- [[#Practiced Rolls ★]] have been reworked. **They no longer add (+) Edge**, but instead allow you to **reroll (1)s** on d12s or (+) Edge die.
- [[#(+) Edge & (‒) Flaw ★]] have been reworked. Now **they are always d4s**, and **you can only ever roll with (2)** of either. This rebalances them to be a bit more predictable so DCs are tad easier to set, though they are still highly impactful!
- [[#Cover & Height Advantage]] now applies to ranged and melee attacks, instead of just ranged attacks. Roll with (+) Edge when you are above your opponent, no matter the tool involved!
- [[#Damage & Modifiers|Pure Damag]] now cannot be reduced by Resistances, Plating, or Immunities (unless otherwise stated).
- Rolling a (12) on a d12 now has more effects,
    - Added an additional option from Decisive Hits to damage your target's weapon, should they carry one.

**Clarifications:**

- Ensured that all references to the Athletics ability were changed to be referred to as the Strength ability.
- All references to Deduction checks have been changed to Investigation checks.
