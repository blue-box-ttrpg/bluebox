For 1AP, your feet alight in flame, exploding periodically.

| Activate Fire Step as a 1AP action. So long as you maintain [[Focused\|Focus]], you may move up to twice your speed in a straight line as a Move Action, and any enemy within 2m of the start of your movement must DEX Save or take (âœ¦) of Fire damage. Those within this affected area cannot take Opportunity Attack against you. |
