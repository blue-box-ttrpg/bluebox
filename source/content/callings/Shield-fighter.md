| For 1AP, choose an ally within 3m. Until the end of your next turn, whenever that ally voluntarily moves, you may follow in as direct a path as possible. You do not provoke Reactions while moving this way.                                                            |

| Shield equipped: When an ally within 3m is targeted by an attack, React! to immediately move directly next to them without provoking Reactions. You may also choose to trade hexes with your ally. You become the new attack target. If hit, your Reaction is not spent. |
| Escalate ⇧: If missed, you may spend (EP⇧) to retain your Reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
