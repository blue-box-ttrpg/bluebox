| For 1AP, you may touch this Tool on a nearby surface. You are able to feel up to 10m from that space in all directions, ignoring [[Hidden]] and [[Invisible]]. You cannot see details, but you are made aware of the general shape and movement of objects/beings, so long as the weapon maintains contact. |
