• While **Hidden**, you cannot be targeted by attacks, other than area-of-effects if your general location is known.

• You add (+1) Edge to initiative rolls if you are **Hidden** at the time of the roll.

• You add (+1) Edge to your first attack roll made while **Hidden**, and add a Power Die (✦) to the damage roll on hit.

**Hidden** ends…
- after you make an attack roll or force a Save.
- when you begin or end your turn in line-of-sight of an enemy (unless you are [[Invisible]]).
- when an enemy succeeds on a contested 1AP Perception vs Stealth roll against you.
