• While Hidden, you cannot be targeted by attacks, other than area-of-effects if your general location is known.


• You add (+1) Edge to initiative rolls if you are Hidden at the time of the roll.

• You add (+1) Edge to your first attack roll made while Hidden, and add a Power Die (✦) to the damage roll on hit.


Hidden ends…
- after you make an attack roll or force a Save.
- when you begin or end your turn in line-of-sight of an enemy (unless you are [Invisible](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEl2LB8uHrA2UrQv1fZHT4yUiFXjuE3nUA9Efl59TPQ/edit#heading=h.bnzic7qosbpu)).
- when an enemy succeeds on a contested 1AP Perception vs Stealth roll against you.
