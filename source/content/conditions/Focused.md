• Some ongoing skills or actions require Focus. When an ongoing action has the Focus tag, it means they cannot perform another action at the same time that requires Focus too.

• Additionally, when a being is “Focusing” and they take damage, they must roll a Focus check to see if they can maintain these actions. On a success, nothing changes, and the Focused skill continues, but on a failure, it ends.

• The DC for Focus checks is equal to the damage received, to a minimum of (6).
