| **Academic:** 1/rest, if you use a Rest Activity (â€¢â€¢â€¢) to research a topic, you automatically pass any Investigation rolls to learn what you need, so long as it is actually possible to learn with the resources or knowledge at your disposal. If it is not possible, you instead know where to go to learn this information. |
