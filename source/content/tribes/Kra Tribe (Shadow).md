| You are [[Resistant]] to Shadow damage but [[Vulnerable]] to Light damage. Your sight is unaffected by natural or supernatural darkness.                                                                                                                               |

| 1/round, when you deal Shadow damage through any means, you may spend (EP⇧) to inflict your target with the [[Blinded ↶]] condition. This remains so long as you maintain [[Focused\|Focus]], until the target passes a 1AP SPI save, or until you lose line-of-sight. |
| Passive \| **Shadow Stalker**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
