| The Kanohi Arthron gives its wearer great awareness around them.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Passive \| **Revealed**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| While equipped, [[Hidden]] attacks against you are regular attacks, and you can see [[Invisible]] beings.                                                                                                                                                    |
| *1AP, 6m, Focus* \| **Blind-sight**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| For 1AP, you may activate the Arthron. So long as you maintain [[Focused\|Focus]], no being or object within 6m is [[Hidden]] from you, and cannot be considered [[Blinded ↶\| Blind ↶]] against them. You are only aware of positions and size, no details. |
