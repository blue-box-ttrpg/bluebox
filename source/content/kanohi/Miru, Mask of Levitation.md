| The Kanohi Miru allows its user to effortlessly float or stop a fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Activate the Miru as a Free Action. So long as you maintain [[Focused\|Focus]], you may levitate. You ignore the effects of Difficult Terrain while levitating, and if you travel in a straight line, you may move up to your speed in the same direction on the following turn - without expending a Move Action. |

| While falling, you may React! to activate the Miru and stop at any point in the fall. Afterwards, the Miru remains active as usual.                                                                                                                                                                                |
