| The Kanohi Ranma grants its bearer the ability to telepathically speak with beings at vast distances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| For 1AP, you may activate the Ranma. Choose a being you can see or have previously met. So long as you maintain [[Focused\|Focus]], you may telepathically speak to them, and they may respond if they choose, so long as they are within the same universe. The further away your target is, the longer it takes for the messages to travel. Every (10) kilometers adds a minute. |
