| The Kanohi Rode grants the wearer special sight to see through illusions, disguises, and to detect lying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| While wearing the Rode, you may see and communicate with spirits, you cannot be fooled by illusions or disguises, and beings with the Invisible condition are always visible to you. Additionally, if you are speaking with a being, you are always aware if they are telling the truth or not - unless they themselves do not know they are lying. |
