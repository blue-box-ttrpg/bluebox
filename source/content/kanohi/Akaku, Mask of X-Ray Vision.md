| The Kanohi Akaku allows you to see through solid objects, one layer at a time.                                                                   |

| *1AP, Focus* \| **See-through Walls**                                                                                                            |
| For 1AP, activate the Akaku. So long as you maintain Focus, you are considered to have line-of-sight on beings through any physical obstruction. |
