| The Hau allows it's wearer to create an impenetrable barrier of runes around them, protecting them from nearly all physical assaults.                                                       |

| For 1AP, engage the barrier. So long as you Focus: You cannot be affected by physical attacks or other damaging physical effects. You cannot attack or force Saves while the Hau is active. |

| • Psychic attacks bypass the barrier.                                                                                                                                                       |
