| The Kanohi Starix gives its wearer insight - clear or vague - of events yet to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| If the Starix is equipped during the full duration of a Short or Long Rest, roll (2) d12s and record the results. Until the next rest, when you, an ally, or an enemy rolls a d12 of any kind, you may choose to replace that with  a recorded rolls. You can choose to do this after the roll is revealed. Discard the used pre-roll afterwards. |
| You do not need to be wearing the Starix to use the pre-rolled results, but you must at least know the general vicinity of the target, and be able to perceive what they are currently doing to some extent.                                                                                                                                      |
